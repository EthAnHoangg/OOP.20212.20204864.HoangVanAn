Question:

If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:

Title and category both have the same type, which is String. Java doesn't allow us to create multiple constructors with the same number of variable of the same data type.
